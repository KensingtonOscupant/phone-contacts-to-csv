Here's how you can do that on both Android and iOS devices:</p><h3>Android</h3><ol><li>Open the "Contacts" app on your Android device.</li><li>Tap the three vertical dots in the top right corner of the screen to open the menu.</li><li>Select "Manage contacts".</li><li>In the Manage Contacts menu, select "Export contacts".</li><li>Choose "All contacts" (or seelct the ones you want) and as the destination, select "Internal storage". Press "Export".</li><li>Then, head over to the standard "Files" app on Android.</li><li>Enter "Contacts.vcf" in the search bar or go to "Internal Storage" and search for it there.</li><li>Once the file is displayed, press it for a few seconds, then select "Share" and there, select some email service (sharing via social media often only exports the first contact). Send it to yourself so that you can access it on your computer.</li></ol><h3>iOS</h3><ol><li>Haven't checked that yet in detail, (here)[tab:https://www.gadgetgone.com/blog/export-contacts-from-iphone/]'s a link to a page that shows how it should work. </li></ol><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>Before getting started, you will need:</p><ul><li>Python 3 installed on your computer, download (here)[https://www.python.org/downloads/]</li><li>The "Contacts.vcf" (name doesn't matter) file you exported from your phone.</li><li>(Of course, Git: Install via Homebrew on Mac and Git for Windows on Windows)</li></ul><h2>Installation</h2><ol><li>Download or clone this repository.</li><li>Open the command line and navigate to the directory where the repository is located.</li></ol><h2>Usage</h2><ol><li>In the command line, run the script by typing <code>python convert.py &lt;vcf_file&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;vcf_file&gt;</code> is the file path of your VCF file.<ul><li>Example: <code>python convert.py C:\Users\username\Contacts\contacts.vcf</code></li></ul></li><li>The script will create a new CSV file with the same name as your VCF file in the same directory.<ul><li>Example: <code>C:\Users\username\Contacts\contacts.csv</code></li></ul></li><li>You can open the CSV file in a program such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to view and edit your contacts.</li></ol><h2>Troubleshooting</h2><ul><li><strong>File not found error</strong>: Make sure the file path of your VCF file is correct and that the file exists in the specified location.</li><li><strong>UnboundLocalError: local variable 'email' referenced before assignment</strong>: This error occurs when the email variable is being used before it is defined or assigned a value. You can initialize the variable 'email' with an empty string before the for loop starts, so that it is defined and can be safely referenced later in the code.</li></ul><p>If you have any issues or questions, please feel free to create an issue in this repository and we will be happy to help you out! ðŸ¤—</p>
